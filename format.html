    <h1>THE RABBIT</h1>
    <b>The little rabbit hopped through the forest, excited to find the perfect hiding spot for its
        treasure.</b><br><br>
    <i>As it burrowed under a big oak tree, it discovered a shiny stone glowing in the moonlight.</i><br><br>
    <strong>Curious, the rabbit picked it up and felt a warm pulse in its paws, as if the stone was alive.
    </strong><br><br>
    <em>Suddenly, a soft voice echoed, telling the rabbit it had found the legendary "Heart of the Forest."
    </em><br><br>
    <mark>The rabbit, now brave, decided to return the stone to the ancient temple hidden deep in the woods.
    </mark><br><br>
    <del>When it arrived, the stone shimmered and released a burst of light, awakening the forest to a new, magical
        dawn.
    </del><br><br>
    <q>Sometimes, the smallest discoveries lead us to the greatest adventures, awakening magic within the world and
        ourselves.
